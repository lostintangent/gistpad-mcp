# üìì GistPad MCP

An MCP server for managing and sharing your personal knowledge/daily notes via GitHub Gists. It's a companion to the GistPad [VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/gistpad) and [GistPad.dev](https://gistpad.dev) (for web/mobile), which allows you to access and edit your gists from any MCP-enabled AI product (e.g. Claude Desktop).

## üèÉ Getting started

> The GistPad MCP server is built using Node.js and so before you perform the following steps, you need to ensure that you've got Node.js already installed.

1. Generate a personal access token that includes only the `gist` scope by visiting https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

1. Add the equivalent of the following to your client's MCP config file (or via an "Add MCP server" GUI/TUI):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gistpad": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "gistpad-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<YOUR_PAT>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
