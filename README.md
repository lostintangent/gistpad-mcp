# üìì GistPad MCP

An MCP server for managing and sharing your personal knowledge, daily notes, and reuseable prompts via GitHub Gists. It's a companion to the GistPad [VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/gistpad) and [GistPad.dev](https://gistpad.dev) (for web/mobile), which allows you to access and edit your gists from any MCP-enabled AI product (e.g. GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop).

## üèÉ Getting started

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The GistPad MCP server is built using Node.js and so before you perform the following steps, you need to ensure that you've got Node.js already installed.

1. Generate a personal access token that includes _only_ the `gist` scope: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

1. If you're using VS Code, then simply click the above badges to install the right config. Otherwise, add the equivalent of the following to your client's MCP config file (or via an "Add MCP server" GUI/TUI):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gistpad": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "gistpad-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<YOUR_PAT>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Restart your MCP client _(optionally, depending on the tool)_

1. :partying_face: Start having fun with gists + MCP! For example, try things like...

   1. **Exploring content**

      - `How many gists have I edited this month?`
      - `What's the summary of my <foo> gist?`

   1. **Creating content**

      - `Create a new gist about <foo>`
      - `Update my <foo> gist to call out <bar>`

   1. **Daily todos**

      - `What are my unfinished todos for today?`
      - `Add a new todo for <foo>`

   1. **Collaboration**

      - `Add a comment to the <foo> gist saying <bar>`
      - `Give me a share URL for the <foo> gist`
      - `View my starred gists`

   1. **Gist organization**

      - `Archive my gist about <foo>`
      - `Add a new <foo> file to the <bar> gist and migrate the <baz> content into it`

   1. **Reusable prompts**

      - `Create a new prompt that searches the web ofor a specified manga series and then provides a summary about it`
      - `Delete my prompt about <foo>`

## üìÅ Included resources

In addition to the above tools, the GistPad MCP server also exposes your gists as resources (using the `gist:///` URI scheme), which allows clients to read them without requiring tool execution.

When you add/delete/duplicate a gist, or change a gist's description, then a notification will be provided to MCP clients, indicating that the list of resources have changed. And if your MCP client supports resource subscriptions, then you can subscribe to a specific gist and get notified when it's updated.

Additionally, for MCP clients that support resource templates, GistPad also exposes a resource at `gist:///{gistId}/comments`, which allows querying the comments for a gist (without needing to execute the `list_gist_comments` tool).

### Resource configuration

If you'd like to expose either your archived gists, starred gists, and/or daily notes as resources, then simply update your MCP server config to pass the `--archived`, `--starred`, and/or `--daily` flags to the `gistpad-mcp` CLI.

## üí¨ Reusable prompts

GistPad allows you to create and manage parameterized/reusable prompts that are stored as markdown files in a gist. You can manage prompts using the `add_prompt` and `delete_prompt` tool, by simply asking your MCP client to create/delete a prompt, with the specified contents/arguments you want.

Behind the scenes, prompts are stored as markdown files in a gist called `üí¨ Prompts` (which is automatically created by the `add_prompt` tool). The prompt files include their prompt as the body, and optionally, a description and arguments using front-matter. And if the prompt makes use of arguments, the body of the prompt should include `{{argument}}` placeholders, which will be replaced when the MCP client retrieves it.

## üíª CLI Reference

The `gistpad-mcp` CLI accepts the following optional flags:

- `--archived` - Include archived gists in the list of MCP resources _(Note: The `list_archived_gists` tool is always available)_
- `--starred` - Include starred gists in the list of MCP resources _(Note: The `list_starred_gists` tool is always available)_
- `--daily` - Include daily notes in the list of MCP resources _(Note: The `list_daily_notes` tool is always available)_
- `--markdown` - Filter the list of gists that are returned, to only those that are composed of Markdown files.
