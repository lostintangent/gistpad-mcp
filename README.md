# üìì GistPad MCP

An MCP server for managing and sharing your personal knowledge/daily notes via GitHub Gists. It's a companion to the GistPad [VS Code extension](https://aka.ms/gistpad) and [GistPad.dev](https://gistpad.dev) (for web/mobile), which allows you to access and edit your gists from any MCP-enabled AI product (e.g. Claude Desktop).

## üèÉ Getting started

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è The GistPad MCP server is built using Node.js and so before you perform the following steps, you need to ensure that you've got Node.js already installed.

1. Generate a personal access token that includes _only_ the `gist` scope: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

1. Add the equivalent of the following to your client's MCP config file (or via an "Add MCP server" GUI/TUI):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "gistpad": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "gistpad-mcp"],
         "env": {
           "GITHUB_TOKEN": "<YOUR_PAT>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. Restart your MCP client _(optionally, depending on the tool)_

1. :partying_face: Start having fun with gists + MCP! For example, try things like...

   1. `How many gists have I updated this month?`
   1. `Create a new gist about the JavaScript programming language`
   1. `Archive my gist about <foo>`
   1. `Give me a share URL for the gist about <bar>`
   1. Much much more!

## üìÅ Included resources

In addition to the above tools, the GistPad MCP server also exposes your gists as resources (using the `gist:///` URI scheme), which allows clients to read them without requiring tool execution.

When you add/delete/duplicate a gist, or change a gist's description, then a notification will be provided to MCP clients, indicating that the list of resources have changed.

<ins>Unsupported/future enhancements:</ins>

- Exposing archived/starred gists as resources
- Allowing clients to subscribe to updates for specific gists
